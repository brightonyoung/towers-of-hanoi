    // calculate the size of the towers for two reasons:
    //
    //   * All towers must be the same size, or otherwise visual consistency is ruined. This means that a tower would
    //     need to know how to resize its brethren, or TowerManager would need to query for the largest tower, then set
    //     the rest of the towers to that size. The first approach violates separation of concerns, since a tower
    //     should only know about itself; the second approach requires TowerManager to deal with resizing towers,
    //     which means I might as well have it calculate the size, too.
    //
    //   * Disks added to towers during game initialization are added in the same manner as when a disk is moved from
    //     tower to tower as a result of user input. As such, if towers were responsible for resizing themselves based
    //     on number of disks, I'd have to create two disk-adding routines: one during game initialization that causes
    //     the towers to dynamically resize, and one used during gameplay that does not cause such resizes to occur.
    //
    // Given these concerns, I determined that including tower size-calculation logic in TowerManager is acceptable.
